# Supabase Integration

This guide will help you set up a webhook integration between Supabase and HookFlo, allowing you to receive real-time alerts when database changes, authentication events, and other activities occur in your Supabase project.

![Supabase Integration Banner](/supabase-logo-wordmark--dark.png)

<Note>
  Supabase uses a combination of database triggers and Postgres functions to deliver webhook events. HookFlo seamlessly integrates with both Supabase's built-in webhooks and custom webhook implementations.

      <div className="w-full">
      ![Create Database Webhook Form](/configure-secret-url-values.png)
      </div>

    </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable HTTP Extension (If Needed)">
    <Accordion title="Configure Http Extension">
      <div className="flex-1">
      For webhooks to function correctly, Supabase needs the HTTP extension enabled. Most projects created after December 2022 have this extension enabled by default.

      To check or enable it:

      1. Go to the **SQL Editor** in your Supabase dashboard
      2. Run the following SQL command:

      ```sql
      create extension if not exists http with schema extensions;
      ```

      3. Click **Run** to execute the command

      </div>
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Tables to Monitor">
    <Accordion title="Choose Database Tables">
      <div className="flex-1">
      When creating your database webhook in Supabase, you can monitor any table:

      - **Public schema tables**: Your application's main tables
      - **Auth schema tables**: Supabase authentication tables to track user-related events
      - **Any other schema**: Custom schemas you've created

      Simply select the appropriate table from the dropdown when creating your webhook. Supabase will send events to HookFlo whenever the selected events (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) occur on that table.

      </div>
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Testing Your Integration

To ensure your integration is working properly:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Test Events">
    <Accordion title="Run Test Events">
      <div className="flex gap-8">
      <div className="flex-1">
      1. In your Supabase project, make a change to the monitored table:
         - Insert a new record
         - Update an existing record
         - Delete a record

      For authentication events, perform the corresponding action (e.g., create a new user).

      </div>

      <div className="w-2/5">
      ![Making a Test Change](/images/test-change.png)

      </div>

      </div>

    </Accordion>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Configuration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Using SQL for Custom Webhook Triggers">
    For more control over your webhooks, you can use SQL to create custom triggers:

    ```sql
    -- Create a function that will trigger the webhook
    create or replace function public.handle_webhook_event()
    returns trigger as $$
    declare
      webhook_url text := 'https://api.hookflo.dev/webhook/supabase/[your-webhook-id]';
    begin
      perform net.http_post(
        webhook_url,
        json_build_object(
          'table', TG_TABLE_NAME,
          'schema', TG_TABLE_SCHEMA,
          'event', TG_OP,
          'record', case when TG_OP = 'DELETE' then old else new end,
          'old_record', case when TG_OP = 'UPDATE' then old else null end
        )::text,
        'application/json',
        array[
          ('x-webhook-id', '[Your webhook ID from HookFlo]'),
          ('x-webhook-token', '[Your webhook token from HookFlo]')
        ]
      );
      return new;
    end;
    $$ language plpgsql security definer;
    
    -- Create a trigger on your table
    create trigger on_users_changed
      after insert or update or delete on public.users
      for each row execute procedure public.handle_webhook_event();
    ```

    This approach gives you fine-grained control over what data is sent and when.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Customizing Notification Templates">
    HookFlo allows you to fully customize your notification templates:

    ### Email Template Example:

    ```
    Subject: [{{event}}] New activity on {{table}}
    
    Hello,
    
    The following {{event}} event occurred on the {{table}} table:
    
    Record ID: {{record.id}}
    Time: {{timestamp}}
    
    Details:
    {{#each record}}
    - {{@key}}: {{this}}
    {{/each}}
    
    Best regards,
    The HookFlo Team
    ```

    ### Slack Template Example:

    ```
    *{{event}} Event on {{table}}*
    
    Record ID: {{record.id}}
    Time: {{timestamp}}
    
    *Details:*
    {{#each record}}
    • {{@key}}: {{this}}
    {{/each}}
    ```

    You can use any data from the webhook payload in your templates.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Webhook Payload Structure

Here's an example of what the webhook payload looks like for different events:

### Database Event Payload

```json
{
  "table": "users",
  "schema": "public",
  "event": "INSERT",
  "record": {
    "id": "d9be2f69-5d13-4ac3-8f77-1193e9b1bfe3",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "created_at": "2023-04-01T12:00:00Z"
  },
  "old_record": null
}
```

### Authentication Event Payload

```json
{
  "event": "SIGNED_UP",
  "instance": "your-project-ref",
  "timestamp": "2023-04-01T12:00:00Z",
  "user": {
    "id": "d9be2f69-5d13-4ac3-8f77-1193e9b1bfe3",
    "email": "user@example.com"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Webhook Not Firing">
    If your webhook isn't sending events to HookFlo:

    <div className="flex gap-8">
    <div className="flex-1">
    1. Check that the `http` extension is enabled in your Supabase project
    2. Verify that your trigger is correctly set up on the table
    3. Check the Supabase logs for any errors related to the webhook function
    4. Ensure the webhook URL and headers are correctly configured

    </div>

    </div>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Performance Considerations">
    For tables with high-frequency changes:

    1. Consider adding conditions to your triggers to only fire on specific records
    2. Implement rate limiting in your webhook function
    3. Use batch processing for high-volume tables
    4. Set up more specific alert rules to filter out noise
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example: Monitoring New User Signups

Here's a complete example of setting up HookFlo to alert your team when new users sign up:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the Webhook in HookFlo">
    Follow the steps above to create a Supabase webhook in HookFlo and configure your notification channels.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Database Webhook in Supabase">
    1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Database** \> **Webhooks**
    2. Create a new webhook named "user-signups"
    3. Select the `auth.users` table (or your custom users table)
    4. Choose the **INSERT** event type to trigger on new user creations
    5. Add your HookFlo webhook URL and headers (x-webhook-id and x-webhook-token)
    6. Save the webhook
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Security Considerations

When setting up webhook integrations between Supabase and HookFlo, keep these security best practices in mind:

- **Protect your webhook credentials**: Keep your x-webhook-id and x-webhook-token secure
- **Use row-level security**: Limit what data can be included in webhook payloads
- **Implement data minimization**: Only send the fields you actually need
- **Regular audits**: Remove webhooks from tables that no longer need monitoring
- **Use HTTPS only**: Ensure all webhook communications use secure protocols
