# GitHub Integration

This guide will walk you through setting up a webhook integration between GitHub and HookFlo, enabling you to receive alerts for repository events such as commits, pull requests, issues, and more.

<Note>
  GitHub webhooks can be configured at the repository or organization level. This guide covers both approaches, with a focus on repository-level webhooks.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- A HookFlo account with an active project
- A GitHub account with admin access to the repository or organization
- Basic understanding of GitHub's development workflow

## Integration Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Webhook in HookFlo">
    <Accordion title="Setting Up Your Webhook Endpoint">
      1. Log in to your HookFlo dashboard
      2. Navigate to **Integrations** > **Webhook Platforms**
      3. Click on **+ Add New** and select **GitHub**
      4. A unique webhook URL will be generated
      5. Generate a webhook secret (or use the auto-generated one)
      6. Click **Save Configuration**
      
      ![GitHub Integration Setup](/images/github-integration.png)
      
      Keep this page open as you'll need both the webhook URL and secret for the next step.
    </Accordion>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a Webhook to Your GitHub Repository">
    <Accordion title="Repository-Level Webhook">
      1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub
      2. Click on **Settings** in the repository navigation
      3. Select **Webhooks** from the left sidebar
      4. Click **Add webhook**
      5. Enter your HookFlo webhook URL in the **Payload URL** field
      6. Select **application/json** as the **Content type**
      7. Enter your webhook secret from HookFlo in the **Secret** field
      8. Choose which events you want to trigger the webhook (see supported events below)
      9. Ensure **Active** is checked
      10. Click **Add webhook**
      
      ![GitHub Webhook Configuration](/images/github-webhook-setup.png)
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="Organization-Level Webhook">
      If you want to receive events from all repositories in an organization:
      
      1. Navigate to your organization on GitHub
      2. Click on **Settings** in the organization navigation
      3. Select **Webhooks** from the left sidebar
      4. Follow the same steps as for repository-level webhooks
      5. When selecting events, you'll have additional organization-specific events available
    </Accordion>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Your Integration">
    <Accordion title="Verifying the Setup">
      To test that your webhook is working correctly:

      1. In GitHub, go to your webhook settings
      2. Find your webhook and click **Deliver webhook**
      3. GitHub will send a ping event to your HookFlo endpoint
      4. Go to your HookFlo dashboard and check the **Event Logs** section
      5. You should see the ping event appear
      
      You can also test with a real event by creating an issue, making a commit, or opening a pull request in your repository.
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported Events

GitHub offers a comprehensive set of webhook events. Here are some of the most commonly used:

### Repository Events
- `push`: When code is pushed to the repository
- `create`: When a branch or tag is created
- `delete`: When a branch or tag is deleted
- `release`: When a release is published

### Pull Request Events
- `pull_request`: Activities related to pull requests
- `pull_request_review`: When a PR review is submitted
- `pull_request_review_comment`: Comments on PR reviews

### Issue Events
- `issues`: Activities related to issues
- `issue_comment`: Comments on issues and pull requests

### Workflow Events
- `workflow_run`: When a GitHub Action workflow run is completed
- `workflow_job`: When a job in a workflow run is queued, in progress, or completed

### Star Events
- `star`: When someone stars a repository

For a complete list of events, refer to the [GitHub Webhooks API documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads).

## Webhook Headers

GitHub webhooks include these important headers that HookFlo uses for verification:

- `x-hub-signature-256`: A signature that proves the webhook came from GitHub
- `x-github-event`: The type of event that triggered the webhook
- `x-github-delivery`: A unique identifier for the delivery

## Webhook Payload Structure

Here's an example of what the webhook payload looks like for a `push` event:

```json
{
  "ref": "refs/heads/main",
  "before": "6113728f27ae8ccbca87773992c3dd9e2de58944",
  "after": "7fd1a60b01f91b314f59955a4e4d4e80d8edf11d",
  "repository": {
    "id": 123456,
    "node_id": "MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM0NTY=",
    "name": "project-name",
    "full_name": "organization/project-name",
    "owner": {
      "name": "organization",
      "email": "org@example.com"
    },
    "html_url": "https://github.com/organization/project-name"
  },
  "pusher": {
    "name": "username",
    "email": "user@example.com"
  },
  "commits": [
    {
      "id": "7fd1a60b01f91b314f59955a4e4d4e80d8edf11d",
      "message": "Fix bug in authentication flow",
      "timestamp": "2023-04-01T12:00:00Z",
      "author": {
        "name": "Developer Name",
        "email": "developer@example.com"
      },
      "url": "https://github.com/organization/project-name/commit/7fd1a60b01f91b314f59955a4e4d4e80d8edf11d"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Webhook Signature Verification Failures">
    If you're seeing signature verification errors:
1. Double-check that you've entered the same secret in both GitHub and HookFlo
2. Ensure the secret doesn't contain any special characters that might be causing issues
3. Check that the correct headers are being sent from GitHub
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing Events">
    If certain events aren't being received:
1. Verify that you've selected those specific event types in GitHub's webhook configuration
2. Check GitHub's webhook delivery logs (in the webhook settings) to confirm they're being sent
3. Ensure your HookFlo webhook is active and properly configured
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Webhook Delivery Failures">
    If GitHub reports delivery failures:
1. Check GitHub's webhook logs for specific error messages
2. Verify that your HookFlo endpoint is accessible from the internet
3. Ensure the webhook URL is entered correctly with the proper protocol (https://)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example: Alerting on Pull Request Reviews

Here's a complete example of setting up HookFlo to alert your team when pull requests are reviewed:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure the Events in GitHub">
    In your GitHub webhook settings, ensure the `pull_request_review` event is selected.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an Alert Rule in HookFlo">
    In HookFlo:
    1. Go to **Alert Rules** > **Create Rule**
    2. Select your GitHub webhook as the source
    3. Add conditions:
       - `headers.x-github-event equals pull_request_review`
       - `action equals submitted`
    4. Select your notification channel (e.g., Slack)
    5. Customize the message: 
       ```
       üìù New PR Review by {{review.user.login}}
       Status: {{review.state}}
       PR: {{pull_request.title}}
       Repository: {{repository.full_name}}
       Link: {{pull_request.html_url}}
       {{#if review.body}}
       Comment: {{review.body}}
       {{/if}}
       ```
    6. Save the rule
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the Integration">
    Create a pull request in your repository and submit a review, then verify that you receive the notification in your selected channel.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security Considerations

When working with GitHub webhooks, keep these security practices in mind:

- Use webhook secrets: Always configure a webhook secret to verify authenticity
- Protect sensitive repositories: Be careful about setting up webhooks on repositories with sensitive code
- Limit event selection: Only subscribe to the events you actually need
- Monitor for unusual activity: Watch for unexpected webhook deliveries
- Restrict access to webhook settings: Limit who can view and modify your webhooks
