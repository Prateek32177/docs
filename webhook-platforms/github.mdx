## Integration Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up a webhook integration between GitHub and HookFlo, enabling you to receive alerts for repository events like code pushes, pull requests, issues, and more.

<Note>
  GitHub webhooks can be configured at either the repository or organization level, giving you flexibility in how you monitor your GitHub activity.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Hookflo only supports GitHub integration only when a secret is provided during webhook creation. Leaving the secret field empty will cause notifications to fail.Prerequisites
</Warning>

- A HookFlo account with an active project
- A GitHub account with admin access to the repository or organization you want to monitor
- Basic understanding of GitHub's workflow and repository management

## Integration Overview

The integration process follows these key steps:

1. Set up a webhook in HookFlo
2. Configure notification channels (email/Slack)
3. Connect GitHub to HookFlo
4. Configure GitHub to send webhooks
5. Test the integration

## Setting Up Your HookFlo Webhook

After logging into HookFlo, follow these steps to create and configure your GitHub webhook:

<Steps>

- `X-GitHub-Delivery`: A unique identifier for the delivery
- `X-Hub-Signature-256`: HMAC SHA-256 signature of the payload (if secret configured)

## Webhook Payload Structure

Here's an example of what the webhook payload looks like for a `push` event:

```json
{
  "ref": "refs/heads/main",
  "before": "6113728f27ae82c7b1a177c8d03f9e96e0adf246",
  "after": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "repository": {
    "id": 123456,
    "node_id": "MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM0NTY=",
    "name": "my-repo",
    "full_name": "username/my-repo",
    "private": false,
    "owner": {
      "name": "username",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "login": "username",

}
```

## Advanced Configuration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Customizing Notification Templates">
    HookFlo allows you to fully customize your notification templates:

    ### Email Template Example for Pull Request:

    ```
    Subject: [GitHub] Pull Request {{action}} by {{sender.login}}
    
    Hello,
    
    A pull request was {{action}} in {{repository.full_name}}:
    
    Title: {{pull_request.title}}
    Author: {{pull_request.user.login}}
    URL: {{pull_request.html_url}}
    
    {{#if pull_request.body}}
    Description:
    {{pull_request.body}}
    {{/if}}
    
    Best regards,
    The HookFlo Team
    ```

    ### Slack Template Example for Code Push:

    ```
    *New code pushed to {{repository.full_name}}*
    
    Branch: {{ref}}
    Pusher: {{pusher.name}}
    
    {{#each commits}}
    • <{{this.url}}|{{truncate this.id 7}}> - {{this.message}} (by {{this.author.name}})
    {{/each}}
    ```

    You can use any data from the webhook payload in your templates using Handlebars syntax.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Filtering Events">
    HookFlo allows you to filter events based on their content:

    1. Go to **Alert Rules** → **Create Rule**
    2. Source: Your GitHub webhook
    3. Add conditions like:
       - Only alert on pull requests to the main branch:

       ```json
       {
         "headers.x-github-event": "pull_request",
         "pull_request.base.ref": "main"
       }
       ```
       - Only alert on failed workflow runs:

       ```json
       {
         "headers.x-github-event": "workflow_run",
         "workflow_run.conclusion": "failure"
       }
       ```
    4. Configure your notification channel and template
    5. Save the rule

    This powerful filtering ensures you only receive alerts for the specific events you care about.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example: Pull Request Review Alerts via Slack

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure GitHub Webhook">
    1. Follow the steps above to create a repository webhook in GitHub
    2. When selecting events, choose **Let me select individual events**
    3. Select the following events:
       - `Pull request reviews`
       - `Pull requests`
    4. Set up a secret and add it to both GitHub and HookFlo
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the Alert">

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure GitHub Webhook">
    1. Follow the steps above to create a repository webhook in GitHub
    2. When selecting events, choose **Let me select individual events**
    3. Select the `Issues` event
    4. Set up a secret and add it to both GitHub and HookFlo
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the Alert">
    1. Create an issue in your repository
    2. Add the "critical" or "bug" label to the issue
    3. Check your email for the alert
    4. Verify the formatting and content match your template
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Webhook Verification Failures">
    If you're seeing webhook verification errors:

    1. Double-check that you've entered the exact same secret in both GitHub and HookFlo
    2. Ensure there are no extra spaces or special characters in your secret
    3. Verify that the Content-Type in GitHub is set to `application/json`
    4. Check if you're using the correct HookFlo webhook URL

    GitHub's webhook signature is case-sensitive and must match exactly. If you're still having issues, try generating a new secret.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing Events">
    If certain events aren't being received:

    1. In GitHub, go to your webhook settings and check the "Recent Deliveries" tab
    2. Look for any failed deliveries and check their response codes
    3. Verify that you've selected the specific event types in GitHub's webhook configuration
    4. Check your HookFlo webhook logs to see if events are being received but filtered out
    5. For organization webhooks, ensure the repository is included in the webhook scope
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Webhook Timeouts">
    If webhook deliveries are timing out:

    1. GitHub expects a response within 10 seconds or it will mark the delivery as failed
    2. GitHub will retry failed webhook deliveries up to 3 times
    3. Check if your HookFlo webhook is processing events efficiently
    4. Consider implementing asynchronous processing for complex event handling
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security Considerations

When setting up webhook integrations between GitHub and HookFlo, keep these security best practices in mind:

- **Always use a webhook secret**: This prevents unauthorized requests to your webhook endpoint
- **Validate all webhook signatures**: HookFlo does this automatically when you provide your secret
- **Limit the scopes of your webhooks**: Only subscribe to events you actually need
- **Use HTTPS only**: All webhook URLs should use encrypted connections
- **Regularly audit webhook configurations**: Remove unused or outdated webhooks
- **Be careful with sensitive data**: Consider what information is included in your notifications
- **Monitor webhook activity**: Regularly review webhook events for suspicious patterns

## Congratulations\! 🎉

You've successfully set up real-time GitHub event tracking and alerting with HookFlo\! Your team can now receive immediate notifications about important repository events, helping you respond quickly to critical issues, coordinate code reviews, and stay informed about your project's development activity.
