## Common Integration Steps

While each platform has its own specific setup requirements, most integrations follow these general steps:

1. **Generate a webhook URL in HookFlo**: Create a new webhook endpoint in your HookFlo dashboard
2. **Configure security credentials**: Set up authentication for secure webhook communication
3. **Select events to monitor**: Choose which events should trigger notifications
4. **Add the webhook URL to the platform**: Configure the platform to send events to your HookFlo endpoint
5. **Test the integration**: Trigger a test event to verify the setup

## Event Processing

When an event is received from any platform, HookFlo:

1. **Verifies the webhook**: Authenticates the request using platform-specific verification methods
2. **Parses the payload**: Extracts relevant information from the webhook data
3. **Matches alert rules**: Determines which notification rules apply to this event
4. **Delivers notifications**: Sends alerts to the configured channels

## Security Considerations

All webhook integrations in HookFlo employ platform-specific security measures including:

- **Signature verification**: Validating that webhooks are genuinely from the claimed source
- **Secret management**: Secure storage of webhook secrets and tokens
- **HTTPS only**: All webhook URLs use encrypted connections
- **Request validation**: Checking timestamp, content, and format of incoming webhooks

For more details on securing your webhook integrations, see our [Security Best Practices](/security/best-practices) guide.

## Custom Platforms

If you need to integrate with a platform that isn't listed here, you can use our [generic webhook](/webhook-platforms/generic) option which provides a flexible endpoint that can accept webhooks from any source.
