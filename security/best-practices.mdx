HookFlo is built with security as a fundamental principle. This guide outlines our approach to securing webhook communication, protecting sensitive data, and ensuring the integrity of all webhook events processed through our platform.

<Note>
  Security is a shared responsibility. While HookFlo provides robust security features, it's important to follow best practices when configuring your webhooks and handling sensitive data.
</Note>

## Core Security Features

### Webhook Authentication & Verification

HookFlo supports multiple methods for authenticating and verifying webhook sources:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="HMAC Signature Verification" icon="shield-check">
    Verify the authenticity of webhooks using HMAC signatures with algorithms like SHA-256
  </Card>
  <Card title="JWT Validation" icon="key">
    Validate JSON Web Tokens using various signing algorithms
  </Card>
  <Card title="API Keys" icon="lock">
    Implement simple key-based authentication for webhook sources
  </Card>
  <Card title="Basic Authentication" icon="user-lock">
    Support for username/password verification methods
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<CodeGroup>

```json HMAC Configuration
{
  "verification": {
    "type": "hmac",
    "algorithm": "sha256",
    "signatureHeader": "X-Hub-Signature-256",
    "signaturePrefix": "sha256=",
    "secret": "${WEBHOOK_SECRET}"
  }
}
```

```json JWT Configuration
{
  "verification": {
    "type": "jwt",
    "algorithm": "RS256",
    "secret": "${JWT_PUBLIC_KEY}",
    "claimValidation": {
      "iss": "api.service.com",
      "aud": "hookflo"
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

HookFlo verifies signatures using the exact algorithm specified by the webhook provider, ensuring compatibility with any service.

### Encryption

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Transport Encryption">
    All API requests use TLS 1.2+ to encrypt data in transit between systems. HookFlo regularly updates its TLS configuration to follow security best practices and disable deprecated protocols or cipher suites.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Storage Encryption">
    All stored webhook data is encrypted using AES-256. Our database encryption ensures that your webhook payloads, configurations, and secrets remain protected even in the unlikely event of unauthorized access to the underlying storage.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Secret Management">
    Webhook secrets and API keys are encrypted with envelope encryption, providing an additional layer of protection for these sensitive credentials. Secret rotation is supported with zero downtime.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You can also implement field-level encryption for particularly sensitive data:

```json
{
  "encryption": {
    "fields": ["$.payment.card_number", "$.user.ssn"],
    "keyId": "payment-processing-key"
  }
}
```

### Access Control

HookFlo implements role-based access control (RBAC) for all resources:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Roles">
    Create custom roles with specific permissions or use our predefined ones: Admin, Developer, and Viewer
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign Resources">
    Control access to specific webhooks, channels, or projects on a per-role basis
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Actions">
    Set granular permissions for who can view, edit, or execute specific functions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Activity">
    Review comprehensive audit logs that track all permission changes and access requests
  </Step>
</Steps>

Teams can implement the principle of least privilege, ensuring users have only the permissions they need.

## Algorithm-Agnostic Payload Processing

HookFlo is designed to work with any webhook format or encoding scheme used by service providers.

### Universal Decoding Support

<Frame>
  ![Payload Processing Flow](/images/payload-processing-flow.png)
</Frame>

Our platform automatically handles various encoding formats:

| Encoding Type   | Description                                          | Use Case                                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Base64          | Decodes Base64-encoded payloads (standard, URL-safe) | Services that encode binary data or compress payloads     |
| URL Encoding    | Parses URL-encoded request bodies                    | Form submissions and legacy webhook systems               |
| JWT Payload     | Extracts and validates claims from JWT tokens        | Modern API systems using token-based authentication       |
| Gzip/Deflate    | Automatically decompresses compressed payloads       | High-volume webhook systems that optimize for size        |
| Custom Encoding | Apply custom decoding functions                      | Proprietary encoding formats unique to specific providers |

Multiple decoding steps can be chained to handle complex encoding schemes:

```json
{
  "preProcessing": {
    "decoding": [
      {
        "type": "base64",
        "target": "body.data"
      },
      {
        "type": "gzip",
        "target": "decodedData"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Comprehensive Algorithm Support

HookFlo supports all commonly used signature verification algorithms:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="HMAC Algorithms" icon="lock-hashtag">
    <ul>
      <li>HMAC-SHA256</li>
      <li>HMAC-SHA1</li>
      <li>HMAC-SHA384/512</li>
      <li>HMAC-MD5 (legacy)</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configurable Retention Policies

<Frame caption="Data Retention Control Panel">
  ![Data Retention Settings](/images/data-retention-settings.png)
</Frame>

Set custom retention periods for webhook data:

- **Time-Based Retention**: Automatically remove data after a specified period
- **Volume-Based Limits**: Limit the number of webhook events stored
- **Field-Level Retention**: Keep metadata longer than sensitive payload content
- **Legal Hold**: Override retention for specific data when legally required

```json
{
  "retention": {
    "eventData": "30d",
    "sensitiveFields": "7d",
    "auditLogs": "1y"
  }
}
```

### Data Sovereignty

For organizations with data residency requirements:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Regional Processing" icon="globe">
    Configure where webhook data is processed to meet local regulations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Storage Location" icon="database">
    Control where data is stored at rest with region-specific storage
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transfer Prevention" icon="shield-slash">
    Restrict data movement between regions with strict boundaries
  </Card>
  <Card title="Compliance Reporting" icon="file-certificate">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

HookFlo can be configured to maintain data within specific geographic boundaries to meet regulatory requirements.

## Network Security

### Source IP Restriction

<Warning>
  Always verify webhook source IPs against the provider's documented IP ranges to prevent spoofing attacks.
</Warning>

Restrict which IP addresses can send webhooks to your endpoints:

```json
{
  "ipFiltering": {
    "mode": "allowlist",
    "addresses": [
      "192.168.1.0/24",
      "203.0.113.42",
      "2001:db8::/32"
    ]
  }
}
```

You can also implement:

- **Dynamic Verification**: Verify source IPs against provider documentation
- **Geo-Restriction**: Optional blocking based on geographic source
- **Rate Limiting by IP**: Prevent abuse from specific sources

### Attack Mitigation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Rate Limiting">
    Configure limits on requests per endpoint to protect against flooding:

    ```json
    {
      "rateLimiting": {
        "maxRequests": 100,
        "perTimeWindow": "1m",
        "perSource": true
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Auto-Blocking">
    Enable automatic temporary blocking of suspicious sources that show attack patterns:

    ```json
    {
      "autoBlock": {
        "thresholds": {
          "failedVerifications": 5,
          "timeWindow": "10m",
          "blockDuration": "1h"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Traffic Analysis">
    HookFlo monitors traffic patterns to detect anomalies and potential abuse attempts:

    - Unusual volume spikes
