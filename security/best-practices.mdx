HookFlo is built with security as a fundamental principle. This guide outlines our approach to securing webhook communication, protecting sensitive data, and ensuring the integrity of all webhook events processed through our platform.

<Note>
  Security is a shared responsibility. While HookFlo provides robust security features, it's important to follow best practices when configuring your webhooks and handling sensitive data.

## Core Security Features

### Webhook Authentication & Verification

HookFlo supports multiple methods for authenticating and verifying webhook sources:

  </Card>
  <Card title="Basic Authentication" icon="user-lock">
    Support for username/password verification methods
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<CodeGroup>

```json HMAC Configuration
{
  "verification": {
    "type": "hmac",
    "algorithm": "sha256",
    "signatureHeader": "X-Hub-Signature-256",
    "signaturePrefix": "sha256=",
    "secret": "${WEBHOOK_SECRET}"
  }
}
```


```json JWT Configuration
{
  "verification": {
    "type": "jwt",
    "algorithm": "RS256",
    "secret": "${JWT_PUBLIC_KEY}",
    "claimValidation": {
      "iss": "api.service.com",
      "aud": "hookflo"
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

HookFlo verifies signatures using the exact algorithm specified by the webhook provider, ensuring compatibility with any service.

## Algorithm-Agnostic Payload Processing

HookFlo is designed to work with any webhook format or encoding scheme used by service providers.

Our platform handles various encoding formats:

| Encoding Type   | Description                                          | Use Case                                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Base64          | Decodes Base64-encoded payloads (standard, URL-safe) | Services that encode binary data or compress payloads     |
| URL Encoding    | Parses URL-encoded request bodies                    | Form submissions and legacy webhook systems               |
| JWT Payload     | Extracts and validates claims from JWT tokens        | Modern API systems using token-based authentication       |
| Gzip/Deflate    | Automatically decompresses compressed payloads       | High-volume webhook systems that optimize for size        |
| Custom Encoding | Apply custom decoding functions                      | Proprietary encoding formats unique to specific providers |

Multiple decoding steps can be chained to handle complex encoding schemes:

```json
{
  "preProcessing": {
    "decoding": [
      {
        "type": "base64",
        "target": "body.data"
      },
      {
        "type": "gzip",
        "target": "decodedData"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Comprehensive Algorithm Support

HookFlo supports all commonly used signature verification algorithms:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="HMAC Algorithms" icon="lock-hashtag">
    <ul>
    <li>
    HMAC-SHA256</li>

    
    <li>
    HMAC-SHA1</li>

    
    <li>
    HMAC-SHA384/512</li>

    
    <li>
    HMAC-MD5 (legacy)</li>

    </ul>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Asymmetric Algorithms" icon="key-skeleton">
    <ul>
    <li>
    RSA-SHA256</li>

    
    <li>
    ECDSA</li>

    
    <li>
    EdDSA (Ed25519)</li>

    </ul>
  </Card>
  <Card title="JWT Algorithms" icon="token">
    <ul>
    <li>
    HS256, HS384, HS512</li>

    
    <li>
    RS256, RS384, RS512</li>

    
    <li>
    ES256, ES384, ES512</li>

    
    <li>
    PS256, PS384, PS512</li>

    </ul>
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

New algorithms are continuously added to maintain compatibility with all webhook providers.

### Verification Methods

<Accordion title="Flexible Verification Strategies">
  Different services implement webhook verification in various ways:

  #### Header-Based Signatures

  - Standard header placement
  - Custom header names
  - Multiple signature headers

  #### Request Parameter Verification

  - Query parameter signatures
  - Form-encoded signatures
  - Timestamp-based verification

  #### Body Hash Verification

  - Complete body hashing
  - Canonicalized JSON
  - Specific field selection

  HookFlo's verification engine can be configured to match any provider's approach, ensuring you can securely process webhooks from any service.
</Accordion>

## Best Practices

### Security Checklist

<Check>
  - Enable signature verification for all webhook sources
  - Implement IP allowlisting for known webhook providers
  - Redact sensitive data fields using JSON path selectors
  - Set appropriate retention periods for webhook data
  - Configure webhook timeout settings to prevent hanging connections
  - Regularly rotate webhook secrets and API keys
  - Monitor the webhook security audit log for suspicious activity
  - Use rate limiting to protect endpoints from abuse
  - Implement strict CORS policies for web-based webhook endpoints
</Check>

### Security Recommendations

<Accordion title="For Public-Facing Endpoints">
  - Always enable signature verification
  - Implement rate limiting and IP filtering
  - Use HTTPS with modern TLS settings
  - Consider adding CAPTCHA for user-initiated webhooks
  - Monitor for unusual traffic patterns
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="For Internal Systems">
  - Use mutual TLS (mTLS) for service-to-service communication
  - Implement network-level isolation for webhook processing systems
  - Consider using private endpoints within your network
  - Implement strict egress filtering for webhook consumers
</Accordion>
