## Slack Webhook Generation Guide

This guide will help you set up Slack as a notification channel in HookFlo, allowing you to receive real-time alerts in your team's Slack workspace when webhook events are triggered.

<Note>
  HookFlo uses Slack's Incoming Webhooks to deliver notifications directly to your channels. This secure approach requires minimal permissions and provides customizable alert formats.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- A HookFlo account with an active project
