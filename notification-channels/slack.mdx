# Slack Notifications

This guide will help you set up Slack as a notification channel in HookFlo, allowing you to receive real-time alerts in your team's Slack workspace when webhook events are triggered.

<Note>
  HookFlo uses Slack's OAuth integration to securely connect with your workspace. This allows for rich, interactive messages with customizable formats.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- A HookFlo account with an active project
- Admin access to a Slack workspace
- At least one webhook platform already configured in HookFlo

    </Accordion>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize Message Templates">
    <Accordion title="Message Formatting">
      HookFlo offers three options for formatting Slack messages:
      
      1. **Simple**: Brief notification with essential information only
      2. **Detailed**: Comprehensive message with expanded data fields
      3. **Custom**: Create your own template using Slack's Block Kit format
      
      For custom templates, you can use our template editor with variables from your webhook payload:
      
      ```json
      [
        {
          "type": "header",
          "text": {
            "type": "plain_text",
            "text": "New {{event_type}} Event"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "section",
          "text": {
            "type": "mrkdwn",
            "text": "*ID:* {{id}}\n*Time:* {{timestamp}}"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "section",
          "text": {
            "type": "mrkdwn",
            "text": "{{message}}"
          }
        }
      ]
      ```
      
      Use the **Preview** button to see how your messages will appear before saving.
    </Accordion>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Your Integration">
    <Accordion title="Verifying the Setup">
      To test that your Slack notifications are working correctly:

      1. In the channel configuration page, click **Send Test Message**
      2. Select which webhook payload to use for the test (or use a sample)
      3. The test message will be sent to your configured Slack channel
      4. Verify that the message appears as expected
      
      You can also trigger a real webhook event from one of your connected platforms and confirm that it appears in Slack.
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
