# Slack Webhooks Integration

This guide will help you set up Slack as a notification channel in HookFlo, allowing you to receive real-time alerts in your team's Slack workspace when webhook events are triggered.

<Note>
  HookFlo uses Slack's Incoming Webhooks to deliver notifications directly to your channels. This secure approach requires minimal permissions and provides customizable alert formats.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- A HookFlo account with an active project
- Admin or appropriate permissions in a Slack workspace
- At least one webhook platform already configured in HookFlo

    </Accordion>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Message Customization

<Accordion title="Message Templates">
  ### Custom Message Formatting
  
  HookFlo provides several options for formatting your Slack notifications:

  1. **Simple**: Brief notification with essential information only
  2. **Detailed**: Comprehensive message with expanded data fields
  3. **Custom**: Create your own template using Slack's Block Kit format
  
  For custom templates, use our template editor with variables from your webhook payload:
  
  ```json
  [
    {
      "type": "header",
      "text": {
        "type": "plain_text",
        "text": "New {{event_type}} Event"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "section",
      "text": {
        "type": "mrkdwn",
        "text": "*ID:* {{id}}\n*Time:* {{timestamp}}"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "divider"
    },
    {
      "type": "section",
      "text": {
        "type": "mrkdwn",
        "text": "{{message}}"
      }
    }
  ]
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Dynamic Routing">
  ### Channel Routing
  
  Send different types of events to different Slack channels:

  1. Create multiple Slack notification channels with different webhook URLs
  2. In your alert rules, specify which channel to use based on event properties
  3. Use template variables for dynamic routing: `#{{team}}-alerts`
  
  This allows you to direct high-priority alerts to urgent channels while sending routine updates elsewhere.
</Accordion>

## Best Practices

<Accordion title="Notification Design">
  ### Effective Alert Design

  Follow these guidelines for creating effective Slack notifications:

  1. **Be concise**: Include only essential information in the main message
  2. **Use color coding**: Indicate severity with appropriate colors (green for success, yellow for warnings, red for critical)
  3. **Provide context**: Include links to relevant systems or dashboards
  4. **Group related notifications**: Use threading to keep channels organized
  5. **Include actionable information**: Make it clear what action is needed, if any
  
  Example of a well-structured alert:
  
  ```json
  {
    "attachments": [
      {
        "color": "#ff0000",
        "pretext": "⚠️ *CRITICAL ALERT*",
        "title": "Payment Gateway Error",
        "title_link": "{{dashboard_url}}",
        "text": "Transaction failed: {{error_message}}",
        "fields": [
          {
            "title": "Customer",
            "value": "{{customer_name}}",
            "short": true
          },
          {
            "title": "Amount",
            "value": "{{currency}} {{amount}}",
            "short": true
          }
        ],
        "footer": "HookFlo Alert • {{formatted_time}}"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rate Limiting">
  ### Avoiding Rate Limits
  
  Slack enforces rate limits on incoming webhooks:

  1. Configure alert batching for high-volume events
  2. Implement cooldown periods for repetitive alerts
  3. Use digest formats for summarizing multiple similar events
  4. Set up circuit breakers to prevent flooding channels during outages
  
  HookFlo automatically handles retries with exponential backoff if rate limits are encountered.
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Common Issues">
  ### Resolving Integration Problems
  
  If you encounter issues with your Slack notifications:

  1. **Messages not appearing**: Verify the webhook URL is correct and hasn't been revoked
  2. **Formatting errors**: Check your message template syntax in the HookFlo dashboard
  3. **Rate limiting**: If sending high volumes, check Slack's rate limit documentation
  4. **Missing data**: Ensure your payload contains the variables referenced in your templates
  
  You can view detailed delivery logs for each notification attempt in the HookFlo dashboard.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Testing Tools">
  ### Debugging Tools
  
  HookFlo provides several tools to help debug your Slack integration:

  1. **Webhook Tester**: Send sample payloads to test your formatting
  2. **Delivery Logs**: View detailed logs of notification attempts
  3. **Request Inspector**: Examine the exact payload sent to Slack
  4. **Template Validator**: Check your message template for syntax errors
  
  Use these tools to quickly identify and resolve any integration issues.
</Accordion>

## Advanced Configuration

<Accordion title="Conditional Notifications">
  ### Conditional Logic
  
  Send notifications only when certain conditions are met:

  ```json
  {
    "conditions": [
      {
        "field": "$.severity",
        "operator": "in",
        "value": ["high", "critical"]
      },
      {
        "field": "$.environment",
        "operator": "eq",
        "value": "production"
      }
    ],
    "operator": "AND"
  }
  ```
  
  This allows you to filter notifications and reduce noise in your Slack channels.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Multiple Workspace Support">
  ### Multi-Workspace Configuration
  
  If you need to send notifications to multiple Slack workspaces:

  1. Create separate apps in each Slack workspace
  2. Configure multiple Slack channels in HookFlo
  3. Use routing rules to direct events to the appropriate workspace
  
  This is particularly useful for agencies or teams supporting multiple clients.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Notification Scheduling">
  ### Time-Based Routing
  
  Configure when notifications are sent with time-based rules:

  1. Set business hours for urgent notifications
  2. Configure different channels for after-hours alerts
  3. Schedule digest summaries for non-critical events
  
  This ensures that notifications reach the right people at the right time.
