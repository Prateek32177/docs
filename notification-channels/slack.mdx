## Slack Integration Guide

This guide will help you set up Slack as a notification channel in HookFlo, allowing you to receive real-time alerts in your team's Slack workspace when webhook events are triggered.

<Note>
  HookFlo now provides a simplified one-click Slack integration that automatically handles permissions and setup. Connect once and use across all your webhooks.
</Note>

## Quick Integration (Recommended)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Your Slack Workspace">
    <Accordion title="One-Click Connection">
      You can connect your Slack workspace from two places:

      **Option 1: From Profile Settings**

      1. Navigate to your Profile → Settings → Integrations
      2. Find the Slack integration section
      3. Click the **"Add to Slack"** button
      4. Authorize HookFlo in your Slack workspace
      5. Once connected, this workspace will be available for all your webhooks

      **Option 2: From Webhook Configuration**

      1. Go to your webhook's notification settings
      2. Look for the Slack notification option
      3. Click **"Add to Slack"** if not already connected
      4. Complete the authorization process

      Both methods work identically - connect once and use everywhere.
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Channel Notifications">
    <Accordion title="Select Channels Per Webhook">
      1. In your webhook's notification settings, toggle **Slack notifications ON**
      2. Select which channel should receive alerts from the dropdown
      3. If your desired channel doesn't appear:
         - Go to that Slack channel
         - Type `/invite @Hookflo` to invite the bot
         - The channel will then appear in the dropdown
      4. Save your settings

      **Key Points:**

      - Each webhook can send alerts to different channels
      - Private channels need the HookFlo bot invited to be selectable
      - One workspace connection works for all webhooks
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Your Setup">
    <Accordion title="Verify Notifications">
      1. Use the test feature in your webhook configuration
      2. Send a test alert to verify it appears in your selected Slack channel
      3. Customize message templates using the Slack template builder if needed

      Your Slack integration is now ready to receive real-time webhook alerts\!
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Your Connection

### Workspace Management

- Only one Slack workspace can be connected at a time
- Change workspaces anytime from Profile Settings → Integrations
- Switching workspaces applies to all webhooks but requires reconfiguring channel selections

### Permissions

HookFlo requests minimal permissions:

- `chat:write` - Send alerts to channels
- `channels:read` - List available channels
- `groups:read` - Access private channels when invited

### Channel Access

If a channel is disabled or missing from the dropdown:

1. Go to the Slack channel
2. Type `/invite @Hookflo`
3. The channel will become available for selection
