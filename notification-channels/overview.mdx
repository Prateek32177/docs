Notification channels are the destinations where HookFlo sends alerts when webhook events are received. This page provides an overview of available notification channels and how to configure them.

## Available Channels

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Slack" icon="slack" href="/notification-channels/slack">
    Send rich, interactive alerts to Slack channels or direct messages
  </Card>
  <Card title="Email" icon="envelope">
    Deliver detailed notifications to individual or group email addresses
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Coming Soon

We're actively working on adding more notification channels:

- Microsoft Teams
- Discord
- Webhook forwarding

## Channel Configuration

Each notification channel type requires specific configuration:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Slack Configuration">
    Slack notifications require:

    - Incoming Slack Channel Webhook URL
    - Channel selection for delivering messages
    - Slack template
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Email Configuration">
    Email notifications require:

    - Recipient email addresses
    - Email subject template
    - HTML and text content email templates
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Key Features

### Message Templating

All notification channels support customizable message templates:

- **Template variables**: Insert dynamic content from webhook payloads
- **Conditional sections**: Show parts of the message only when certain conditions are met
- **Markdown support**: Format your messages with rich text
- **Preview capability**: Test your templates before saving

### Filtering & Routing  (Coming soon)

Control exactly when and where notifications are sent:

- **Event filtering**: Send notifications only for specific event types
- **Content-based rules**: Apply conditions based on the webhook payload content
- **Channel routing**: Send different types of events to different channels
- **Priority levels**: Set importance levels for different types of alerts

### Scheduled Digests (Coming Soon)

Instead of receiving individual notifications, you can configure digest summaries:

- **Hourly digests**: Collect and summarize events from the past hour
- **Daily reports**: Get a daily summary of all events
- **Weekly summaries**: Receive a weekly rollup of activity
